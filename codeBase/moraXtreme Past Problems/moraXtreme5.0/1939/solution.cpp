    Apporach: If voco is a leaf vertex (number of adjacent vertices = 1) it can be captured by the first player immediately thus, Stalind wins. Otherwise, they both have to
              capture the other vertices alternatively before they capture the city voco. Therefore, start a BFS / DFS from the city voco and count the number of grandchildern 
              of voco. Since the requirement to capture a city is at most having one grandchild, if (#grandchildren - 1) is even, always the first player wins and if it is odd, 
              the second player wins.
              
    Time Complexity: O(n) since the graph is a tree
