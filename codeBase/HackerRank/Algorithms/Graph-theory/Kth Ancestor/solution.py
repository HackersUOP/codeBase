    Problem Statement:    A tree of P nodes is an un-directed connected graph having P - 1 edges. Let us denote R as the root node. If A 
    is a node such that it is at a distance of L from R, and B is a node such that it is at at distance of L + 1 from R and A is 
    connected to B, then we call A as the parent of B.
    Similarly, if A is at a distance of L from R and B is at a distance of L + K from R and there is a path of length K from A to B, 
    then we call A as the Kth parent of B.
    Susan likes to play with graphs and Tree data structure is one of her favorites. She has designed a problem and wants to know if 
    anyone can solve it. Sometimes she adds or removes a leaf node. Your task is to figure out the Kth parent of a node at any instant.
    
    NOTE:
    Each node index is any number between 1 and 10^5 i.e., a tree with a single node can have its root indexed as 10^5.
    
    Approach:   This problem is a famous Graph Theory problem and is known as the "Level Ancestor Query problem". (Actually, this's a
                variant of the Level Ancestor Problem) Before proceeding any further, understanding the problem and it's solution require
                some definitions about Tree Data Structure.
                
                What is a Tree? As the problem states, a Tree is an un-directed connected graph. Therefore, if the tree has P nodes,
                it has P - 1 edges. A rooted tree is a tree which has an arbitrary vertex as the root.
                
                Depth of a vertex:  The depth of a vertex u in a tree T is denoted as depth(u) and it's the level in which it's located,
                starting from depth(root) = 0 i.e. depth(u) = #edges on the shortest path from root to u.
                
                Example: Suppose node 1 is the root.
                                                  1             Node |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |
                                                /   \           Depth|  0  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  2  |  2  |  
                                               2     3
                                              / \    |
                                             5   6   4
                
                Descendant:   A descendant node of a node is any node in the path from that node to the leaf node (including the leaf 
                node). The immediate descendant of a node is the “child” node.
                
                Deepest descendant:   Let v be a descendant of the vertex u in a tree T and Pv the path from u to v (which is unique).
                Then v is the deepest descendant of u if and only if |Pv| >= |Px| for all descendants x of u.
                
                Height of a vertex:    The height of a vertex u in a tree T, denoted as height(u), is the number of levels we have to go 
                through, if we want to travel from u to one of its deepest descendants (which is a leaf). Note that here, the leaves 
                are defined to have height 1. i.e. height(u) = #vertices on the path from u to one of its deepest descendants
                
                Ancestor:   An ancestor node of a node is any node in the path from that node to the root node (including the root node).
                The immediate ancestor of a node is the "parent" node.
                
                
                The Level Ancestor Problem:   Let T = (V, E) be a rooted tree with |V| = n, |E| = n - 1. Pre-process the tree and
                answer the level ancestor queries (find the ancestor v of the query node u at depth K + depth(u) / Kth ancestor 
                / Kth parent).
                
                LA_T(u, K) = v, if v is the unique ancestor of u with depth(v) = depth(u) - K.
                LA_T(u, K) = 0, if such an ancestor doesn’t exist.
                
                NOTE:   LA_T (u, root) = u and LA_T (u, depth(u)) = root ∀u ∈ V.
                
                
                There're three different Algorithms to solve the Level Ancestor Problem:
                        (1). Table Algorithm    (O(n^2) time for preprocessing, O(1) time for answer a query)
                        (2). Jump - Pointer Algorithm   (O(nlogn) time for preprocessing, O(logn) for answer a query)
                        (3). Ladder Algorithm   (O(n) time for preprocessing, O(logn) time for answer a query)
                        
                Table Algorithm is a naive approach using Dynamic Programming to fill a table: table[i][j] which is the ancestor of
                node j at depth i therefore the table will be n x n in size.
                
                But I've used the Jump-Pointer Algorithm for this problem because O(nlogn) + O(logn) time is sufficient to pass the
                test cases. The solution is coded in an object-oriented way for the simplicity.
                
                I have created two separate objects as Graph (for graph traversal) and Tree (for the operations in the tree). After the
                edges of the tree are added to the graph, a Breadth-First Search traversal is done on it to build the Tree by traversing
                level by level while filling the depth dictionary which contains the depths of each vertex.
                
                When queries are asked the find method is called from the Tree object to find the kth ancestor if exists, using the 
                parents dictionary and the pre-calculated depth dictionary. To find the kth ancestor, according to the Jump-Pointer 
                Algorithm, the smallest possible k value of the node is calculated, which is: floor(log2(k)). Then, we set the ancestor
                to be floor(log2(k))th ancestor of the node and parent array of the node to be the parents of the floor(log2(k))th 
                ancestor. Next, k is reduced by 2^floor(log2(k)). These four steps are repeated until the k value is reached 0 (This
                is actually a binary search over the ancestors of the node).
                
                Time Complexity:   O((n + 1)log(n)) in total.
