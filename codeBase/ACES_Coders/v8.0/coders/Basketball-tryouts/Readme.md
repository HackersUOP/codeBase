# Basketball Tryouts - Solution 

The constraints of the problem are,
N < 500000
D < 1000000

For a solution to work in under 2 sec for C / 4 sec for JAVA or 10 sec for python, the solution ought to be of time complexity O(N log(N)) at worst.

No team scored full marks for this question during the competition. But several users have scored full marks while upsolving the problem after the competition ended. These solutions are of order O(N^2). Apparently, it is possible to get full marks for this question even with an O(N^2) solution with several clever tweaks.

O(N log(N)) Solution: Solution.cpp
O(N^2) solutions : Solution_dtdinidu7.py , Solution_InterGreat_UOP.py
